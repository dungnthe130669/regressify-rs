# Artifact Path Safety

## Start Here

[Path/config resolution](../../../src/config/mod.rs),
[portable CLI IDs](../../../src/cli/args.rs), [atomic I/O](../../../src/helpers/io.rs),
and [desktop workspace paths](../../../src/desktop/workspace.rs).

## Procedure and Invariants

1. Separate user-selected output roots from logical IDs/relative artifact paths.
   A custom output root may be outside the workspace; a capture/run/state name
   must not become an arbitrary path or silently select a different root.
1. Reuse the owning boundary's checks: components, canonical containment, regular
   file/directory type, symlink policy, and Windows reserved/trailing characters.
   String prefixes and lexical normalization alone are insufficient.
1. Handle missing optional files separately from I/O errors. Revalidate at write,
   copy, delete, package, and open boundaries rather than trusting earlier UI input.
1. Use same-directory temporary writes/copies. Preserve a valid destination on
   failure and clean temporary artifacts; atomic replacement is not a transaction
   or conflict detector for multiple concurrent writers.

## Checks

```sh
cargo test --lib helpers::io::tests
cargo test --lib cli::args::tests
cargo test --features desktop --lib desktop::workspace::tests
```

Cover parent/absolute paths, symlink escape, missing parents, regular-file checks,
Windows device names, permission failures, repeat writes, and external conflicts.
State platform-specific coverage explicitly when symlink tests cannot run.

## Maintain

Update the owning command/desktop docs and this skill when path contracts change.
Comment why a boundary permits or rejects links; do not claim race-free writes
unless handle/locking behavior actually establishes that guarantee.
